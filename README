# Calibre-watch

watching a dir, when some file added, run calibredb to add book to calibre

## why

I have a mac server running at home, calibre-web is running on it.
I usually download book at company and sync it to my mac server using SynologyDrive.
I Want my mac can automatically add book when SynologyDrive have new book received.


## how

* using `chokidar` for file watching
* using `launchd` to keep this tool always running.
